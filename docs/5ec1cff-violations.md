# Violations and Practices of TrickyStore Author

## üì¶ Use of Open-Source Code Without Proper Licensing

- Took headers from AOSP for stubbing without providing proper attribution or respecting licensing norms [¬π](#references).
- Statically linked an LGPLv3 library into their binary but failed to release their source or comply with LGPL requirements [¬≤](#references).

## üö´ "All Rights Reserved"

- Initially published code with **no license**, making it "all rights reserved" despite using open-source components [¬≥](#references).
- Invited pull requests (‚ÄúPRs welcome‚Äù) while keeping the code legally closed ‚Äì **taking from the community without giving back** [‚Å¥](#references).

## üîí Shift to Fully Closed-Source

- After releasing a few open-source versions, decided to fully close-source the project with:
  - Encrypted module binaries
  - Obfuscated APKs
- Claimed:  
  > ‚ÄúDue to rampant misuse and fewer contributions than expected, this module will be closed-source starting from version 1.1.0.‚Äù [‚Åµ](#references)
